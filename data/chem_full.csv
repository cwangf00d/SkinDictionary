Aloe Vera,Skin soother,"Calms, soothes, and hydrates the skin","In general, anyone looking to soothe burns, including sunburn and windburn, and moisturize their skin.",Nussbaum recommends applying it two to three times daily.,"To increase the calming benefits, Nussbaum suggests using it with anti-inflammatory ingredients.","Nussbaum says to avoid using aloe vera products that also contain alcohol, which will negate the moisturizing, soothing effects of the aloe, and also avoid combining it with chemical exfoliants, which could worsen any stinging or irritation. If you have a burn, Nussbaum advises against using it with an ointment or petrolatum, which will trap the heat inside."
Alpha Hydroxy Acids,Acid/chemical exfoliant,"Exfoliate the top layers of skin to minimize dullness and even out texture; some AHAs can also stimulate collagen production, while others have antioxidant and hydrating properties.","Given their wide range of effects, most people can benefit from using AHAs, says Nazarian, so long as you find the right alpha hydroxy acid and concentration of it for your particular skin type.","This differs greatly based on the particular acid, product, and your skin. Follow product directions, but always start slow, using any AHA only once or twice per week and gradually increasing frequency as your skin can tolerate it, suggests Nussbaum.","Peptides can slow the penetration of AHAs, making them less irritating, says Nussbaum. You can also pair them with hydrating ingredients.","Avoid using retinoids at the same time of day as AHAs, and be cautious when using both BHAs (beta hydroxy acids, such as salicylic acid) and AHAs in order to minimize irritation."
Amino Acids,Varying,"Soothe skin, help moisturize, act as antioxidants","In general, whatever amino acids are added to your skincare will be catered to the function of the product.",How often can you use it? You can use amino acids as often as you want; they are gentle enough for everyday use.,"Pretty much everything; glycerides, ceramides, and peptides in particular.",Amino acids can be mixed with a host of other ingredients.
Amoxicillin,Antibiotic,Most commonly used to treat upper respiratory bacterial infections and urinary tract infections; sometimes used as a second-line treatment for acne.,"Those dealing with moderate to severe inflammatory acne, and who can't take the tetracycline class of antibiotics (monocycline, doxycycline) because of allergy or pregnancy.","It's usually prescribed twice daily for acne, though as with any antibiotics for acne, it should be discontinued after three to four months of use.","Oral antibiotics are generally paired with topical medications that contain benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids, says Zeichner.","Other topical antibiotics, which can increase the likelihood of developing bacterial resistance."
Apple Cider Vinegar,Exfoliator,"Balances pH, chemically exfoliates, and antibacterial.","In general, people with oily and acneic skin.",The use of apple cider vinegar depends on what product and concentration you're using it in.,Anti-inflammatories.,"Other acids, retinoids."
Arbutin,Brightener,"Lightens dark spots, lessens appearance of acne scars, helps even out skin tone.",Arbutin is generally safe for all skin types.,Arbutin can be used twice a day. It is safe to apply on clean skin with other creams and serums. It can also be used in the summer since it does not make skin more sensitive to the sun.,"Vitamin C, AHAs","While there are no known negative interactions with other skincare ingredients, heat can degrade the effectiveness of arbutin.﻿﻿"
Argireline,Peptide,"Prevents the muscle movement that leads to wrinkle formation. Argireline also promotes collagen production and optimizes the function of collagen, which both fight fine lines and improve moisture levels in the skin, says Shah.",Anyone looking to smooth out wrinkles caused by repeated muscle movement in areas such as the forehead and around the eyes. It’s also a good pick for anyone with dry skin as it actually helps allocate moisture to the area of application.,It can be used daily.,"One study suggests that it works well in conjunction with another peptide, tripeptide-10-cirtrulline, which increases the permeability for argireline to penetrate to a depth where it can target muscles that cause wrinkles, says Linkner. It’s also often combined with hyaluronic acid to up the hydration benefits.","Generally speaking, argireline works well with all ingredients."
Ascorbyl Glucoside,Antioxidant,"Neutralizes skin-damaging free radicals, inhibits the production of pigment to fade and prevent dark spots, boosts collagen production.","In general, because this is a less potent version of vitamin C, it's a good option for all skin types and anyone looking to brighten a dull complexion, enhance radiance, and stave off signs of aging such as fine lines and wrinkles, advises Nussbaum.","Recommended use is usually once a day, though it can be used twice daily as well.","As an antioxidant, ascorbyl glucoside plays nice with many different ingredients, though it works especially well with niacinamide, a type of vitamin B. ""When combined, these two ingredients can help address issues such as loss of firmness and elasticity, wrinkles and fine lines, unevenness in the complexion, and large pores,"" explains Solomon. All antioxidants also work well with sunscreen, offering an added layer of protection.","Benzoyl peroxide can oxidize vitamin C and should therefore be avoided. Vitamin C and retinol are active at different pHs and therefore should be used separately if you want the full potential of each ingredient, notes Nussbaum."
Avocado Oil,"Antioxidant, emollient, and anti-inflammatory.",Helps the skin maintain hydration and minimizes damage from free radicals.,"Because of its anti-inflammatory properties, Russak recommends avocado oil for anybody who has eczema, acne, seborrheic dermatitis, or psoriasis.","Avocado oil is safe to use daily in a dilute form. If it is included in a product’s formulation, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.","Russak recommends combining avocado oil with retinol. “The most absorption of the retinol happens with a fat-soluble content,” Russak explains. “Combining it together with an oil will increase absorption and decrease the irritation from it.” Although avocado oil has moisturizing properties, Hayag says it also would be beneficial for maximal moisture to use it in combination with a humectant like hyaluronic acid in order to draw water into the skin.","There are no ingredients that contraindicate with avocado oil, but Russak suggests refraining from using the oil with other oils, such as vitamin K. “You’re really just creating too much of the lipids on the surface of the skin, and lipids start competing in terms of how they penetrate into the skin, so it will decrease the efficacy of whatever you’re trying to do,” Russak explains."
Azelaic Acid,Exfoliant,"Fights acne, treats rosacea, lightens pigmentation, and removes dead skin cells.","In general, anyone with acne-prone, rosacea-prone skin and hyperpigmentation.

Biotin,B complex vitamin,Contributes to overall skin health,"According to Jaliman, anyone deficient in biotin can take the supplement.","Garshick says the general dose of a biotin supplement used is 2.5 to 3 mg (2500 to 3000 mcg) a day, but it hasn't been extensively studied, so it is still unknown what the best optimal dosing is. However, Jaliman says a supplement is safe for daily use for most but advises people to follow the directions on the specific product they purchase. Because it depends on the micrograms, Jaliman suggests checking the label to decide how often it should be taken.","Jaliman recommends combining biotin with protein supplements. ""Protein helps the body to produce keratin, which is vital to the hair structure and also skin and nails,"" Jaliman explains. She also recommends taking collagen in conjunction with a biotin supplement. ""Collagen is found in the layer of the skin that gives the skin its fullness and plumpness,"" she adds.","Garshick says some antibiotics and anti-seizure medications can affect the absorption of biotin, so it is always best to discuss with your doctor prior to starting a biotin supplement (or any supplement, in general)."
Butylene Glycol,"Humectant, solvent, and emollient","Retains moisture, dissolves ingredients, and improves application.","In general, anyone looking for a way to effectively moisturize their skin.",Butylene glycol is safe for daily use for those who do not have an allergy to it or very sensitive skin.,"As a solvent, butylene glycol works well with ingredients that are not water-soluble and are difficult to dissolve.","Butylene glycol works well with most, if not all, ingredients."

Caprylyl Glycol,Moisturizer,"Attracts water to and holds it in the skin, but also has preservative-like properties that can help prevent other ingredients from spoiling and extend the shelf life of the product, says Palep. It also helps products spread and absorb more easily into skin, says Belkin.","Generally speaking, it works well for all skin types, especially those looking to keep their skin smooth and moisturized.","This is largely dependent on the product within your regimen that contains capryl glycol in the formula, says Solomon. Generally speaking, moisturizers and lotions can be used throughout the day, but in case there's another active ingredient in there that may cause irritation with multiple uses, the safest thing is to follow particular product instructions.","It is often used with other ingredients known to hydrate the skin, such as honey, aloe, and hyaluronic acid, says Solomon.","As a rule, it can be used with most other ingredients."

Charcoal,Adsorbent,Removes toxins,"Theoretically, charcoal can remove excess oil, so those with oily skin would benefit the most from trying a charcoal-based skincare product.","Because there are no proven benefits when used in skincare, Wong says there is no information on how often charcoal should be used on the skin. However, Levin adds that charcoal is inert and does not cause allergic reactions or irritation.","Clays, which can absorb oil from the skin.","Because charcoal adsorbs (binds to) other substances to remove them, Wong says it's a good idea to avoid using actives with the ingredient but adds that they can be used after the charcoal has been rinsed off."
Cocoa Butter,Hydrator,"Heals chapped skin, moisturizes, fights aging","In general, anyone who in need of a body moisturizer—however, if you easily get body acne, you might want to skip this one.","As much as you want, really.","Vitamin E oil, shea butter",Other potentially pore-clogging ingredients
Collagen,Protein.,Moisturizes the skin.,"Graf says in general, anyone interested in moisturization and anti-aging can use collagen skincare.","Graf says topical collagen, as well as oral collagen, can be used on a daily basis. When applied to the skin, collagen can be used be morning or night or both as it's not sun-sensitizing.","If your ultimate goal of using collagen skincare is to stimulate collagen production, Hayag recommends adding to your routine a retinoid or retinol (which she calls the gold standard for boosting collagen) or peptides and growth factors as a less irritating option that can help by acting as “messengers” to signal cells to create collagen. Hayag also recommends vitamin C (another collagen producer) and sunscreen with UVA protection to prevent your collagen from breaking down further.","In general, collagen is safe to use with most ingredients and topical products. ""When you apply hydrolyzed collagen, it gets right into the skin and penetrates rapidly,"" Graf explains, and for that reason, she says it shouldn't interfere with any other product or ingredient."
Colloidal Oatmeal,Skin protectant.,"Protect, prevent water loss, and soothe the skin.","In general, colloidal oatmeal can be used by anyone to hydrate and moisturize the skin, but King says it is particularly helpful for those with dry skin and conditions like eczema.",The recommended use for colloidal oatmeal is twice daily.,"Colloidal oatmeal can be used in conjunction with ingredients that can be irritating to the skin, such as alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids and retinoids, to help minimize irritation and disruption of the skin barrier.","Colloidal oatmeal works well with most, if not all, other ingredients."

Emollients,Moisturizing agent,Smoothes and softens the skin by helping to repair cracks in the skin barrier thus preventing water loss; acts as a lubricating agent in products.,"WHO SHOULD USE IT Emollients are good for most skin types, the one exception being those with naturally very oily skin, notes Greenfield. In this case, emollients, particularly heavy, oil-rich products, can potentially be too heavy and lead to clogged pores and breakouts.","HOW OFTEN CAN YOU USE IT Barring the exception noted above about oily skin and thicker emollients, they can generally be used regularly and liberally.","﻿WORKS WELL WITH ""Emollients work well with a range of other skincare ingredients,"" says Nussbaum. In moisturizers, emollients work best when paired with other moisturizing agents that have occlusive or humectant properties, meaning they coat and cover the skin or attract water to it, respectively, she explains. They can also be combined with other actives, such as anti-inflammatory botanical extracts.","DON'T USE WITH Avoid pairing emollients with ingredients that can have potentially irritating side-effects that you don't want sealed into the skin, cautions Nussbaum, who cites retinols and alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids as common examples."
Eucalyptus Oil,Essential oil,"It has antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, though Chang says more studies are needed to confirm these skin benefits.",Neither Chang nor Robinson recommends eucalyptus oil for dermatologic applications.,"Eucalyptus oil can be inhaled as needed to ease cold symptoms or relax the muscles, but neither dermatologist recommends the use of eucalyptus oil for dermatologic applications.","Like most essential oils, eucalyptus oil should always be diluted in a carrier solution, such as a fatty oil, before use.",Inform your doctor of any medications you’re taking or products you’re using before trying eucalyptus oil.

In this case, you can up the ante to retinaldehyde, which can be more potent and effective at jumpstarting your skin cells, says Nussbaum.","While it’s important to ease into things in order to let your skin gradually acclimate to the ingredient, it can ultimately be used daily.","Alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids have commonly been used with retinoids to help further increase skin cell turnover, says Chilukuri (though it's important to make those separate parts of your routine, using one in the AM and one in the PM). Using antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and niacinamide can also help improve the skin brightening effects, he adds. However, use these ingredients together with caution, and decrease use if you notice irritation.","Avoid using any retinoid at the same time as products with vitamin C, AHAs, or BHAs, as this can up the likelihood of sensitivity and irritation, says Nussbaum.

Palmitate,Exfoliator,"Promotes skin cell turnover, improves skin tone, helps unclog pores, helps thicken the dermis to slow down the formation of wrinkles.","Because retinyl palmitate is the least irritating of all four retinoids (more on that in a minute), it's a great option for almost all skin types and anyone who want to keep their pores clear and skin youthful, says Solomon. It does still have to the potential to be somewhat irritating for those with extremely sensitive skin, however.","While it’s important to ease into things in order to let your skin gradually acclimate to the ingredient, it can ultimately be used daily.","According to Lain, ""Retinoids have a synergistic effect with antioxidants such as vitamins C, E, and ferulic acid."" Pairing any retinoid with a sunscreen is also important, since they can make your skin more susceptible to the sun.","Since retinyl palmitate has exfoliating properties, avoid combining it with other chemical exfoliants, such as glycolic or salicylic acid, as well as harsh scrubs with abrasive ingredients, cautions Lain. This holds especially true if you fall into the super sensitive skin camp. It can also cause some dryness, notes Solomon, so it's a good idea to pass on toners and astringents, too."

These ingredients work by helping the active ingredients in a product penetrate through the skin and make them more effective, but Lu points out that this process can be irritating for those with sensitive and dry skin types."
