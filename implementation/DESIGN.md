# Design of Skin Dictionary
## How it Came Together
### Inspiration
I decided to create Skin Dictionary because I've always been fascinated by skincare.
There just seems to be an abundance of products, videos, information about everything skincare. 
Yet, the sheer flood of skincare information is actually often overwhelming, confusing, and contradictory. 
I wanted to create a website that serves as the centralized hub of information for all-things skincare.

I've always planned for this website to be a personal project extending beyond CS50 with three main aims:
1. provide information about skin physiology and recent peer-reviewed publications as well as a general-public-friendly, dynamic and exciting "web encyclopedia" on skincare ingredients and conditions.
2. give recommendations to users on the best skin products for their needs
3. serve as a platform for advocacy and information about under-represented groups in skincare.

Within the time constraint of the CS50 Final Project, however, I had to narrow the scope of my project. At the start of my project, I decided that I wanted to focus on my second aim, the treatment recommendation aspect of my website.
Thus, my goal for myself was to create a small version of my website that allows users to get product recommendations tailored to their specific needs and compare products. While there is certainly a lot more that I wish to accomplish with this project, I feel satisfied with the project I have submitted and pushed to Github!
